Topics include privacy concerns, data security, artificial intelligence ethics, and the equitable distribution of technological benefits, ensuring responsible development and use of technology.
    \item \textbf{Interperter vs Compiler:} Interpreters and compilers are tools used to execute programs written in high-level languages. An interpreter translates code line-by-line into machine code at runtime, while a compiler translates the entire code into machine code before execution. Each approach has different performance and debugging implications.
    \item \textbf{The creator of python:} Python was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Van Rossum designed Python with an emphasis on readability, simplicity, and ease of use, making it a popular language for beginners and professionals alike. Python has since evolved into one of the most widely used programming languages.
    \item \textbf{Compare multiple Programming Languages:} Comparing programming languages involves evaluating their syntax, performance, use cases, and community support. Languages like Python, Java, and C++ offer different strengths: Python is known for ease of use, Java for portability, and C++ for performance. The choice of language often depends on the specific requirements of a project or application.
    \item \textbf{Networking:} Networking involves the exchange of data between computers and devices through various protocols. Key protocols include TCP/IP for reliable data transmission, HTTP for web communication, and DNS for domain name resolution. Understanding networking is crucial for setting up and maintaining efficient and secure communication systems in various environments.
    \item \textbf{RaDAR:} Radar (Radio Detection and Ranging) uses radio waves to detect and locate objects. It emits radio waves that bounce off objects and return to the radar receiver, allowing the determination of distance, speed, and direction. Limitations include reduced accuracy in adverse weather conditions and difficulties detecting small or low-reflectivity objects.
    \item \textbf{LiDAR:} Lidar (Light Detection and Ranging) uses laser pulses to measure distances to objects, creating high-resolution 3D maps. It operates by sending laser beams and measuring the time it takes for the reflections to return. Limitations include reduced effectiveness in fog, rain, or snow, and potential high costs associated with the technology.
    \item \textbf{camera (type, how it works, limitations, etc.):} Cameras capture visual information using sensors such as CCD or CMOS. They convert light into electronic signals to create images.
